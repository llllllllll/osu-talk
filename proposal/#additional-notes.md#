I plan on walking through the development of
a [project](https://github.com/llllllllll/lain) to predict user scores in a
rhythm game from user replays. This talk comes from my personal experience
trying implement this project and teaching myself about neural networks. I
personally found it disheartening that many examples were stripped of all real
world challenges, or at worst, random data used just to show the Keras API. The
goal of the talk is not to be a comprehensive guide to LSTM neural networks, but
instead be a starting point, or point of reference for someone who wants to
implement their own model. I hope to show people one way to think about their
problem but will not explore all possible options.

If possible, I would like audio for the presentation. The project being
discussed predicts a user's performance in a rhythm game and I would like to
show a short clip of the gameplay so the audience can get a sense for the
problem. I can work around this if it is not available.
