Most neural network examples and tutorials use fake data or present poorly
performing models. In this talk, we will walk through the process of
implementing a real model, starting from the very beginning with data collection
and cleaning. We will cover topics like feature selection, window normalization,
and feature scaling. We will also present development tips for testing and
deploying models.
